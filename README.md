# DeepMRM

DeepMRM is a targeted proteomics data interpretation package using deep-learning. It takes MRM, PRM, or Data-Independent Acquisition (DIA) data and target list as input and outputs peaks of targeted peptides, along with their abundances and quality scores. The targeted endogenous (light) peptides are detected and quantified using their stable isotope labeled (heavy) peptides.

## Installation (without GPUs)

DeepMRM was tested on Ubuntu 20.04 and Windows 10.  

1. Install Anaconda or Python v3.9
   - Anaconda: https://www.anaconda.com/download
   - Python: https://www.python.org/downloads/

2. Clone the repository and move to the deep-mrm directory in a terminal
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/bertis-informatics/deep-mrm.git
   ```

3. Create a virtual environment, and activate it

   * When using conda
      ```
      conda create -n deepmrm python=3.9
      conda activate deepmrm
      ```

   * When using venv module in Python standard library
      ```sh
      python -m venv env
      .\env\Scripts\activate
      ```

4. Install required packages
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirments.txt
   ```
   
5. Install DeepMRM package
    ```sh
   python setup.py install
   ```


## How to run
1. Open a terminal and activate the virtual environment created during the installation

2. Run DeepMRM running script with a mass-spec file (mzML) and a target list (csv). You can find sample input files in [sample_data](https://github.com/bertis-informatics/deep-mrm/tree/main/sample_data) directory.

    ```sh
    python deepmrm/predict/make_prediction.py -target ./sample_data/sample_target_list.csv -input ./sample_data/sample_mrm_data.mzML
    ```

    Syntax
    
    * -input: string path for input mzml file
    * -target: string path for target csv file. The csv file should contain following columns:
        * `peptide_id`: unique ID for each targeted peptide (heavy and light transitions are grouped by peptide_id)
        * `precursor_mz`: m/z values for targeted precursor ions
        * `product_mz`: m/z values for targeted fragment ions
        * `is_heavy`: flag indicating light or heavy peptides (TRUE or FALSE)

            ---------------------------------------------
            Example of target list

            |peptide_id|precursor_mz|product_mz|is_heavy|
            |----------|------------|----------|--------|
            |PDAC0008|798.36005|966.4759|FALSE|
            |PDAC0008|798.36005|1210.596|FALSE|
            |PDAC0008|798.36005|1472.6759|FALSE|
            |PDAC0008|800.36676|972.496|TRUE|
            |PDAC0008|800.36676|1216.596|TRUE|
            |PDAC0008|800.36676|1478.696|TRUE|       
    * -tolerance: int, default=10. Ion match tolerance (in PPM). This is ignored in the case of MRM data.
